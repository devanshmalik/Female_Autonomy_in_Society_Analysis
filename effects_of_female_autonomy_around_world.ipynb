    "**Source**: [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) has collected a lot of information about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years, and on a number of different indicators. From their list of 500+ indicators, the following indicators related to women literacy and engagement in society peeked my interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Literacy rate, adult female (% of females ages 15 and above)\n",
    "    * Adult literacy rate is the percentage of people ages 15 and above who can, with understanding, read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life\n",
    "2. Mean years in school (women of reproductive age, 15 to 44)\n",
    "    * The average number of years of school attended by all people in the age and gender group specified, including primary, secondary and tertiary education. \n",
    "3. Mean age at 1st marriage of women\n",
    "    * The average age, in years, of first marriage for women. Women who never married are excluded. Cohabitation is excluded\n",
    "4. Age 15-64 Female Labor to population (%)\n",
    "    * For age group 15-64, percentage of female labor to total female population.\n",
    "5. Under-Five Mortality rate (per 1,000 live births)\n",
    "    * The probability that children born in a specific year will die before reaching the age of five, if the age-specific mortality rates remain the same."

    "Since Gapminder has data on more than 500 indicators ranging in economy, population, health, etc. it is crucial to have a topic of interest prior to choosing indicators. \n",

    "I was interested in looking at factors related to females, specifically indicators related to women literacy, autonomy and engagement in society. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Factors\n",
    "The main independent factors explored are adult female literacy rate and mean years in school. The effect of women literacy on mean age at first marriage is explored along with the cumulative effect of all these factors on female labor participation in the economy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final factor explored in Child Mortality Rate and whether women's rights and autonomy are correlated to the mortality rate in a society."

    "### Regression Interpretation\n",
    "The output above looks intimidating to anyone without any background in statistics and linear regression models. Let's break down the most important aspects for our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **R-Squared**: Most people even vaguely familiar with linear regression have heard about R-squared. The R-squared is always between 0 and 100% and is a measure of how close the data are to the fitted line. Contrary to how widespread R-squared is, it is not as useful in indicating whether a model is a good fit. Although a high R-squared value is desired, a low R-squared does not mean the model is useless. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Regression Coefficients (`coef(β)` )**: The two regression coefficients are `intercept` and `school_years` where the `intercept` value is almost always useless due to statistical reasons not necessary to dive deep into here. The coefficient for `school_years` is **0.6557** which means that for every extra year of education a female receives, on *average* the age at first marriage increases by 0.6557 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **P-value (`P>|t|`)**: Assuming that the null hypothesis is true, which in this analysis implies that the coefficient for `school_years` is actually 0 instead of 0.6557, p-value is the probability of how likely it is that we observe an effect equal to or greater than the effect observed in the analysis. Hence, a lower p-value is better implying that it is less likely that the observed effect is possible even if the actual value is 0. Thus, the p-value for `school_years` is extremely close to 0% which means `school_years` is a significant predictor in this model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Standard Error (`std err`)**: Standard error (S) is in the units of response variable (`marriage_age`) and is the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line. In other words, it is a predictor of how wrong the regression model is on average. The value of S is 0.061 years which is a relatively low value for the purposes of our analysis as we're not interested in using the model for prediction purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other parameters that can be analyzed for the model but the factors above are a solid starting point in interpreting the fit. "

    "### Female Literacy vs Marriage Age Conclusion\n",
    "The goal of our analysis is to analyze the general trend between the variables instead of using it for predictive purposes. Based on this purpose, the linear model does a satisfactory job in highlighting how the marriage age of females aorund the world increases as they acquire more education. \n",

    "With lack of research on effect of labor participation on child mortality rates, we look at a plot of `child_mortality` versus `labor_participation`. Based on the scatterplot below, no trend can be observed as child mortality is spread over all ranges of female labor participation. Hence, female labor participation in a society will not be included as a predictor in the multiple regression model. "

    "\n",
    "The different analyses performed provide the following insights: \n",
    "* The level of female education has improved all around the world between 1970 and 2005 with an average increase of 4 to 6 years of additional education in most countries. \n",
    "* Marriage age and female literacy are associated with an average increase of `0.6557 years (95% CI: [0.536, 0.775])` in age at first marriage for every extra year of education. \n",
    "* No corellations were observed between female literacy and autonomy on the labor participation of females in a society. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations \n",
    "* The results of regression analysis are geared towards understanding the associations between the predictors and not to be used to accurate predictive purposes. \n",
    "* We cannot state that female autonomy and literacy **cause** lower child mortality rates as the data is obtained from observational studies. There are a multitude of factors that affect child mortality rates and the factors change depending on the region of the world and its social and economic norms. \n",
    "\n",
    "**We have observed statistically significant associations between female literacy, autonomy and child mortality rates. This suggests that initiatives to curtail child mortality rates should extent beyond providing better medical services and focus on prioritizing women's rights and autonomy in societies. Greater education for females provides greater autonomy over their decisions and focusing on social well being of females may augment the survival of children.**"
